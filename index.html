				<h2>Throttle with Debounce</h2>

				<code>throttleWithDebounce(fn, delay)</code>

				<p>Creates a new version of the function <code>fn</code>, which will not execute more often than once every <code>delay</code> milliseconds regardless of how many times it is called. If one or more executions is blocked, it will be called one more time after the delay has passed since the last time it was called.</p>

				<h3>Arguments</h3>

				<h4>fn</h4>

				<p>A function to be throttled.</p>

				<h4>delay</h4>

				<p>The number of milliseconds for which the function should be unable to be called after each time it is executed. This delay also serves as the delay before the final execution of the function if it was blocked.</p>

				<h3>Examples</h3>

				<p>This button has been throttled with a debounce at a delay of 200&nbsp;ms:</p>

				<button class="button activate-button js-throttle-with-debounce-fast" data-activate-count="0">200&nbsp;ms delay</button>

				<p>This button has been throttled with a debounce at a delay of 1000&nbsp;s:</p>

				<button class="button activate-button js-throttle-with-debounce-slow" data-activate-count="0">1000&nbsp;ms delay</button>
